# Linear-Systems-Final-Project-Code

This repo publically stores my code for my ASE 381P1 Linear System final project. Namely, the Matlab and Maple files that I use to compute various matrices and in general evaluate the system given in part c are stored here.

The Matlab file contains many comments of lines used to generate the needed results. Since some of those lines were time-expensive, their results are hard coded just after the commented code.

Maple was used to symbolic manipulation when it was deemed more convenient than Matlab. Each portion of part c could have multiple Maple files, denoted by the file names.

I intended to create this repo much earlier. If I had, many more pushes would be present.
